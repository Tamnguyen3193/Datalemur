--Assume you're given tables with information on Snapchat users, including their ages and time spent sending and opening snaps.
Write a query to obtain a breakdown of the time spent sending vs. opening snaps as a percentage of total time spent on these activities grouped by age group. 
Round the percentage to 2 decimal places in the output--

SELECT 
  t1.*,
  t2.age_bucket

ON t1.user_id = t2.user_id
