--Assume you're given a table containing information about Wayfair user transactions for different products. 
Write a query to calculate the year-on-year growth rate for the total spend of each product, grouping the results by product ID.

The output should include the year in ascending order, product ID, current year's spend, previous year's spend and year-on-year growth percentage, 
rounded to 2 decimal places.--

WITH data AS(--cal total spend in the current year--
SELECT
  EXTRACT(year from transaction_date) AS year,
  product_id,
  SUM(spend) AS curr_year_spend
FROM user_transactions
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 2,1 ASC)

,data2 AS(--get data of total spend in the previous year--
SELECT
  *,
  LAG(curr_year_spend) OVER(PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY year) AS prev_year_spend
FROM data)

SELECT

  ROUND((curr_year_spend-prev_year_spend)*100.0/prev_year_spend,2) AS yoy_rate
