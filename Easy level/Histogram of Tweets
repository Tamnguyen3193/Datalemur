--Assume you're given a table Twitter tweet data, write a query to obtain a histogram of tweets posted per user in 2022. 
Output the tweet count per user as the bucket and the number of Twitter users who fall into that bucket.
In other words, group the users by the number of tweets they posted in 2022 and count the number of users in each group--


SELECT 
  tweet_num AS tweet_bucket,
  COUNT(user_id) AS user_num
FROM
  (SELECT 
    user_id,
    COUNT(tweet_id) AS tweet_num
  FROM tweets
  WHERE tweet_date BETWEEN '01/01/2022' AND '12/31/2022'
  GROUP BY user_id) AS total_tweet
GROUP BY tweet_num;
