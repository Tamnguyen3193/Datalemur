--Assume you're given two tables containing data about Facebook Pages and their respective likes (as in "Like a Facebook Page").
Write a query to return the IDs of the Facebook pages that have zero likes. The output should be sorted in ascending order based on the page IDs--

SELECT 
  t1.page_id
FROM pages as t1
LEFT JOIN page_likes as t2
ON t1.page_id = t2.page_id
GROUP BY t1.page_id
HAVING COUNT(t2.liked_date) = 0
ORDER BY t1.page_id;
